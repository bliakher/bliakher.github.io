My name is Evgenia Golubeva and I'm from Prague, Czech republic. I'm a computer science student at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) at the [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UK-1.html) about to graduate in September 2022. 

At university I most enjoyed C# and web development. I would like to start my career as a backend/full stack developer.

My GitHub username is [bliakher](https://github.com/bliakher).

### My hobbies

I really enjoy crafts, especially crochet and embroidery. I also like to get my life organised and creative by using a bullet journal. I love reading fantasy books and travelling. 

I also like to join coding projects with my friends.
